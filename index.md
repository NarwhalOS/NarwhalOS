## Welcome to NarwhalOS!
 Its is based on Ubuntu and I'm trying to make it more like windows.

##When will it come out?

When i get Ubuntu Mate 18.04 LTS installed and make a Live ISO that has the propper theme and package setup.

The package manager is APT so when you install items youu run
```markdown
Sudo apt install {Package name}
```
or
```markdown
Sudo apt-get install {Package name}
```
So I will kep you updated
